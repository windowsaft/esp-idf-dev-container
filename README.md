The following guide explains how mount an ESP32 (devboard) for usage inside this VSCode dev container. 

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / 11
- WSL2
- Docker Desktop
- `usbipd` (install via `winget install usbipd`)

## Steps

### 1. Forward the USB Device to WSL

When running Docker on Windows with WSL 2, you'll need to forward the USB device to your WSL distribution using `usbipd`. Here's how you do it:

1. List all available USB devices on Windows:

    ```bash
    usbipd list
    ```

    You should see a list of devices connected to your system, along with their BusID (e.g., `1-1`). Your ESP32 should look something like this: <br> `9-3; 10c4:ea60  Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM3); Not shared`
<br>
2. Register the device for sharing:

    ```bash
    usbipd bind --busid 9-3
    ```
    Replace `<BusID>` with the BusID of your USB device.
<br>
3. Attach the USB device to your WSL 2 distribution:

    ```bash
    usbipd attach --wsl  --busid <BusID>
    ```

    Replace `<BusID>` with the BusID of your USB device. Optionally you can the specify the distribution to witch the USB device should be attached with ` --distribution <distribution-name>`. This is not requiered since the system will pick one if not specified. The `<distribution-name>` would be the WSL2 distro name (e.g. `ubuntu`, `docker-desktop`). If the USB device should be automatically re-attach when the device is detached or unplugged use `-a`.


### 2. Identify the USB Device in WSL

Once the USB device is attached to your WSL 2 distribution, identify the device in WSL. You can list all connected devices with the following command:

```bash
dmesg | grep tty
```

Look for a line mentioning your device (e.g., `cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0`). This will be the device path you will use to mount the USB device inside the container.

### 3. Edit the dev container config

Inside the [docker-compose.yml](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml) file look for the parameter line `- devices`. Make sure you mount your device there to make it available inside the dev container. It is possible to add multiple devices to your container.
Hereâ€™s on how to do that (e.g. for root path = `/dev/ttyUSB0`)

```bash
"/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0"
```

### 4. Verify the Device is Mounted

Once inside the container, verify that the device is correctly mounted by listing the `/dev` directory:

```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
```

If the device is mounted, you should see an output like this:

```bash
crw-rw----    1 root     dialout   188,   0 Sep 21 12:00 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

This confirms that the device is available inside the container.




## Notes

- Make sure the USB device is properly connected to your host system before starting the container.
- **make sure in the windows device manager that windows has fond the appropriet firmware for your devie**
- The path `/dev/ttyUSB0` may vary depending on the specific USB device you are using. Adjust accordingly.
